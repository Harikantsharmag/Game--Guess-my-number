# Game--Guess-my-number
"Guess My Number" is a fun number-guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players guess a random number between 1 and 20, receiving hints if the guess is too high or low. The game tracks the score, records the high score, and includes a reset feature, with dynamic color changes for feedback based on the guess.
